Pretty pictures are down the bottom!

I actually can't believe it. 

I've always loved running but have had a bit of a rollercoaster journey with it. 

Like many of us, hated it in school. Cross country sucked. 

My identity in many ways has always been tied to cycling - I rode to school, it was the only sport I stuck at for an extended period of time and I loved heading off on weekend rides. Despite this, I always loved the simplicity and accessibility of running.

As long as you have a decent pair of shoes, you can be running anywhere within minutes. Cycling, on the other hand requires a bike (\$\$\$), kit (\$\$) and time.

So when I started running again about 12 months ago, you can imagine how unbelievably stoked I was when the foot pain I had experienced through high school and covid stayed away. Sure, I had a run-in (pun not intended) with runner's knee earlier this year but that resolved itself with proper running shoes, rest and rehab exercises.

After doing the Barwon Heads triathlon in February, I learned how much I resonated with having an end goal to work towards. My housemate JoÃ«lle had done the Great Ocean Road Half Marathon the last few years, and suggested we sign up for the 2025 edition.

Then the tickets sold out.

Then I got a ballot offer.

Then the payment failed.

Then they threatened to rescind the ballot ticket.

THEN I GOT AN ENTRYYYYYYYYY.

We followed the free training plan provided, and boy did I love having a regime to stick to. The long runs were fun as long as you'd allocated your weekend's time to them, and the shorter runs felt unbelievably chill.

I ran from the summit of Mount Hotham to Dinner Plain village, I ran from my place to my parents for dinner, and I ran with people I wouldn't normally.

On the day, we were blessed with clear skies and rainbows - with only a well-timed  sprinkle to cool us down after a particularly warm climb. The day in Lorne beforehand had been raining cata and dogs so I was very glad the local atmosphere had gotten it out of its system.

My only goal had been to get a sub-2hr time for the half marathon distance, WHICH I DID.
