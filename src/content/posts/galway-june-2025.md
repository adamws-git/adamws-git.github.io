For the first time since 2019, all of us were back in Ireland.

*The Latin Quarter of Galway*

Taking the opportunity, Jamie, Charlie, Sofia and I booked a trip down to Galway for a night. This was the first year we had access to a car, meaning a trip like this sans-rents was on the cards.

We headed off from Enniskillen, dodging tractors, breakdowns and walkers as we crossed the border into the Republic of Ireland. Arriving in Galway, we suddenly realised we had no plans for parking. Three hot laps of the town later we scored a spot in the multilevel and headed for the hostel.

We had lunch in a tiki-inspired Jungle Cafe (authentic...), perused the local knitwear (foreshadowing) that the local area is known for, checked out the Spanish Arch and generally got our bearings.

We also discovered an amazing bookshop that had rooms upon rooms upon rooms. With huge sections dedicated to Irish authors and topics, I'd walk out the next day with a selection of John Kavanaugh's works.

For dinner, we went to a local gastropub John Keogh's in the westend and had possibly the biggest oysters known to man. From there, it was on to the Salt House for some live music to round out the night.

Come morning, we were the first ones up and out of the dorm room to make the most of the day. A little too early, as it turns out...nothing was open yet.

*COFFEE WERX*

*COFFEE WERX*

We stopped by Ernie's, a local grocer with some amazing produce (served by Erni himself) and to a very cool coffee shop - Coffee Werx - for one of the best coffees I've had in Ireland. To Dela cafe for a fry up and then to the main event - jumper shopping.

Made in Ireland from Irish Merino, this jumper is unbelievably warm.

*My new jumper!*

I'm now ready to head out into the Atlantic on a fishing trawler.

A final stop in at the Galway City Museum taught us that this area is where the Claddagh Ring is originally from, with the oldest known ring (made by jeweler Richard Joyce) kept in Galway.

With jumpers bought we hit the road for Sligo and met the rain on the road. With it pelting down in Sligo, the others searched for lunch while I wandered around the town, finding the SLIGO sign.

Lunch for me? Supermac's on the way out of town (what is Supermac’s? As the hostel worker said (“sure it’s like McDonald’s but Irish and better”).

A real treat.
